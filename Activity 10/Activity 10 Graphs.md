    A -> B -> C
     \   | \  |
       \ v  \ v
         D -> E



2. (see code)


3.  Both the graph and the program follow the big O time complexity of O(V + E). This is because it visits every vertex and edge once. The space complexity is represented as O(V) because they are similar in graph scale size. The main difference between the functionality of BFS and DFS is that the former follows a queue, while the latter uses a stack. This makes BFS generally better for finding shorter paths, and DFS better for sorting.
