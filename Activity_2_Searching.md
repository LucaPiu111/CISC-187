# Questions

1. It would take 4 steps to perform a linear search for “8” in the array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13].
  (check 2, 4, 6, and then finally 8)

2. It would take 1 step to perform a binary search for “8” in the array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13].
  (starts in the middle, where the “8” already is)

3. It would take a maximum of 17 steps to perform a binary search on an array of 100,000 elements. This is because the formula for calculating the worst-case scenario for a binary search algorithm is log2N, rounded up to the nearest whole number.
  (log2(100,000) ≈ 16.6 -> 17)

4. (see Activity 2 Searching.cpp)
