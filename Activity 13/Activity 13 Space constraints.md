1. The space complexity of this algorithm is represented as O(n^2). This is because it first has an outer loop that repeats n times [O(n)], and then also has another inner loop which also repeats n times, so it is n * n = n^2.

2. The space complexity for this function here is represented by O(n). This is because there is only one for loop which repeats n times, which creates a new array the same size as the inputted one.

3. (see code)
